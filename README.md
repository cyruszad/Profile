# Hi, I'm Cyrus (@cyruszad)! 👋

I'm passionate about developing AI-driven projects, focusing on cutting-edge voice agents and innovative video applications that interact dynamically with users. I'm also skilled at designing efficient databases that power smart, data-driven decisions. Currently, my work is centered on transforming the music industry through technology, with plans for a social platform for independent artists and an advanced AI voice assistant in the pipeline.

- 👀 I’m interested in: Building AI projects that integrate voice technologies, interactive video solutions, and robust data systems to innovate within the music industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: My focus is on Python and JavaScript. I utilize PostgreSQL for my database projects and explore various service integrations. Rather than diving into Swift for iOS development, I'm considering a leading JavaScript framework for cross-platform mobile apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: While I'm focused on independent projects at the moment, I'm open to future collaborative ventures.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me at [career@cyruszad.com](mailto:career@cyruszad.com).
- 😄 Pronouns: I prefer not to use pronouns.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I blend creative flair with analytical precision—making me a developer who’s anything but ordinary!
